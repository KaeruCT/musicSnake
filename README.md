Originally created for https://repl.it/talk/challenge/Rhythm-game-musicSnake/16702

A rhythm game with music that changes as you play.

Initially I wanted to make the song 100% autogenerated but I ended up choosing some bass lines and melodies that worked together and playing with that instead.

All the music is generated from your browser using ToneJS.

Because of this it might not work so well on mobile devices, sorry!
It's a bit laggy on my phone.

For the best experience I recommend you try this on a computer :)
